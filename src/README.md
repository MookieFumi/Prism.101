# NBAStats Xamarin Forms project

This repo will help us in the Prism - 101 Introduction meetup. It´s an easy app with bad practices, all code is in XAML or code behind :(

So, we´re going to apply the next steps:

* First one: Add MVVM
* Last one: Add Prism framework

## Existing pages

* LoginPage
* MyTabbedPage
  * PlayersPage
  * SettingsPage

## Prism check list

* Dependency injection
* Commanding
* Navigation
* EventAggregator
* Page Dialog
* Application lifecycle management
